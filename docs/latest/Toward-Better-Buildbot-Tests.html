<h4 class="subsection">7.9.1 Toward Better Buildbot Tests</h4>

<p>In general, we are trying to ensure that new tests are <i>good</i>.  So what makes a good test?

<h3 class="heading">Independent of Time</h3>

<p>Tests that depend on wall time will fail. As a bonus, they run very slowly. Do
not use <code>reactor.callLater</code> to wait "long enough" for something to happen.

   <p>For testing things that themselves depend on time, consider using
<code>twisted.internet.tasks.Clock</code>.  This may mean passing a clock instance to
the code under test, and propagating that instance as necessary to ensure that
all of the code using <code>callLater</code> uses it.  Refactoring code for
testability is difficult, but wortwhile.

   <p>For testing things that do not depend on time, but for which you cannot detect
the "end" of an operation: add a way to detect the end of the operation!

<h3 class="heading">Clean Code</h3>

<p>Make your tests readable. This is no place to skimp on comments! Others will
attempt to learn about the expected behavior of your class by reading the
tests. As a side note, if you use a <code>Deferred</code> chain in your test, write
the callbacks as nested functions, rather than using object methods with funny
names:

<pre class="example">     def testSomething(self):
       d = doThisFirst()
       def andThisNext(res):
         pass # ...
       d.addCallback(andThisNext)
       return d
</pre>
   <p>This isolates the entire test into one indented block. It is OK to add methods
for common functionality, but give them real names and explain in detail what
they do.

<h3 class="heading">Good Name</h3>

<p>Your test module should be named after the package or class it tests, replacing
<code>.</code> with <code>_</code> and omitting the buildbot_. For example,
<code>test_status_web_authz_Authz.py</code> tests the Authz class in
<code>buildbot/status/web/authz.py</code>. Modules with only one class, or a few
trivial classes, can be tested in a single test module. For more complex
situations, prefer to use multiple test modules.

   <p>Test method names should follow the pattern test_METHOD_CONDITION where METHOD
is the method being tested, and CONDITION is the condition under which it's
tested. Since we can't always test a single method, this is not a hard-and-fast
rule.

<h3 class="heading">Assert Only One Thing</h3>

<p>Each test should have a single assertion. This may require a little bit of work
to get several related pieces of information into a single Python object for
comparison. The problem with multiple assertions is that, if the first
assertion fails, the remainder are not tested.  The test results then do not
tell the entire story.

   <p>If you need to make two unrelated assertions, you should be running two tests.

<h3 class="heading">Use Mocks and Stubs</h3>

<p>Mocks assert that they are called correctly. Stubs provide a predictable base
on which to run the code under test. See
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object">Mock Object</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_stub">Method Stub</a>.

   <p>One of the difficulties with Buildbot is that interfaces are unstable and
poorly documented, which makes it difficult to design stubs.  A common
repository for stubs, however, will allow any interface changes to be reflected
in only one place in the test code.

<h3 class="heading">Small Tests</h3>

<p>The shorter each test is, the better. Test as little code as possible in each test.

   <p>It is fine, and in fact encouraged, to write the code under test in such a way
as to facilitate this. As an illustrative example, if you are testing a new
Step subclass, but your tests require instantiating a BuildMaster, you're
probably doing something wrong! (Note that this rule is almost universally
violated in the existing buildbot tests).

   <p>This also applies to test modules.  Several short, easily-digested test modules
are preferred over a 1000-line monster.

<h3 class="heading">Isolation</h3>

<p>Each test should be maximally independent of other tests. Do not leave files
laying around after your test has finished, and do not assume that some other
test has run beforehand. It's fine to use caching techniques to avoid repeated,
lengthy setup times.

<h3 class="heading">Be Correct</h3>

<p>Tests should be as robust as possible, which at a basic level means using the
available frameworks correctly. All deferreds should have callbacks and be
chained properly. Error conditions should be checked properly. Race conditions
should not exist (see "Independent of Time", above).

<h3 class="heading">Be Helpful</h3>

<p>Note that tests will pass most of the time, but the moment when they are most
useful is when they fail.

   <p>When the test fails, it should produce output that is helpful to the person
chasing it down. This is particularly important when the tests are run
remotely, in which case the person chasing down the bug does not have access to
the system on which the test fails. A test which fails sporadically with no
more information than "AssertionFailed?" is a prime candidate for deletion if
the error isn't obvious. Making the error obvious also includes adding comments
describing the ways a test might fail.

<h3 class="heading">Mixins</h3>

<p>Do not define setUp and tearDown directly in a mixin. This is the path to
madness. Instead, define a <code>myMixinNameSetUp</code> and
<code>myMixinNameTearDown</code>, and call them explicitlyi from the subclass's
<code>setUp</code> and <code>tearDown</code>. This makes it perfectly clear what is being
set up and torn down from a simple analysis of the test case.
