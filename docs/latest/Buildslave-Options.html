<h4 class="subsection">2.5.1 Buildslave Options</h4>

<p>There are a handful of options you might want to use when creating the
buildslave with the <samp><span class="command">buildbot create-slave &lt;options&gt; DIR &lt;params&gt;</span></samp>
command. You can type <samp><span class="command">buildbot create-slave --help</span></samp> for a summary. 
To use these, just include them on the <samp><span class="command">buildbot create-slave</span></samp>
command line, like this:

<pre class="example">     buildbot create-slave --umask=022 ~/buildslave buildmaster.example.org:42012 myslavename mypasswd
</pre>
     <dl>
<dt><code>--usepty</code><dd>This is a boolean flag that tells the buildslave whether to launch child
processes in a PTY or with regular pipes (the default) when the master does not
specify.  This option is deprecated, as this particular parameter is better
specified on the master.

     <br><dt><code>--umask</code><dd>This is a string (generally an octal representation of an integer)
which will cause the buildslave process' &ldquo;umask&rdquo; value to be set
shortly after initialization. The &ldquo;twistd&rdquo; daemonization utility
forces the umask to 077 at startup (which means that all files created
by the buildslave or its child processes will be unreadable by any
user other than the buildslave account). If you want build products to
be readable by other accounts, you can add <code>--umask=022</code> to tell
the buildslave to fix the umask after twistd clobbers it. If you want
build products to be <em>writable</em> by other accounts too, use
<code>--umask=000</code>, but this is likely to be a security problem.

     <br><dt><code>--keepalive</code><dd>This is a number that indicates how frequently &ldquo;keepalive&rdquo; messages
should be sent from the buildslave to the buildmaster, expressed in
seconds. The default (600) causes a message to be sent to the
buildmaster at least once every 10 minutes. To set this to a lower
value, use e.g. <code>--keepalive=120</code>.

     <p>If the buildslave is behind a NAT box or stateful firewall, these
messages may help to keep the connection alive: some NAT boxes tend to
forget about a connection if it has not been used in a while. When
this happens, the buildmaster will think that the buildslave has
disappeared, and builds will time out. Meanwhile the buildslave will
not realize than anything is wrong.

     <br><dt><code>--maxdelay</code><dd>This is a number that indicates the maximum amount of time the
buildslave will wait between connection attempts, expressed in
seconds. The default (300) causes the buildslave to wait at most 5
minutes before trying to connect to the buildmaster again.

     <br><dt><code>--log-size</code><dd>This is the size in bytes when to rotate the Twisted log files.

     <br><dt><code>--log-count</code><dd>This is the number of log rotations to keep around. You can either
specify a number or <code>None</code> (the default) to keep all
<samp><span class="file">twistd.log</span></samp> files around.
