<p>A day in the life of the buildbot:

     <ul>
<li>A developer commits some source code changes to the repository. A hook
script or commit trigger of some sort sends information about this
change to the buildmaster through one of its configured Change
Sources. This notification might arrive via email, or over a network
connection (either initiated by the buildmaster as it &ldquo;subscribes&rdquo;
to changes, or by the commit trigger as it pushes Changes towards the
buildmaster). The Change contains information about who made the
change, what files were modified, which revision contains the change,
and any checkin comments.

     <li>The buildmaster distributes this change to all of its configured
Schedulers. Any &ldquo;important&rdquo; changes cause the &ldquo;tree-stable-timer&rdquo;
to be started, and the Change is added to a list of those that will go
into a new Build. When the timer expires, a Build is started on each
of a set of configured Builders, all compiling/testing the same source
code. Unless configured otherwise, all Builds run in parallel on the
various buildslaves.

     <li>The Build consists of a series of Steps. Each Step causes some number
of commands to be invoked on the remote buildslave associated with
that Builder. The first step is almost always to perform a checkout of
the appropriate revision from the same VC system that produced the
Change. The rest generally perform a compile and run unit tests. As
each Step runs, the buildslave reports back command output and return
status to the buildmaster.

     <li>As the Build runs, status messages like &ldquo;Build Started&rdquo;, &ldquo;Step
Started&rdquo;, &ldquo;Build Finished&rdquo;, etc, are published to a collection of
Status Targets. One of these targets is usually the HTML &ldquo;Waterfall&rdquo;
display, which shows a chronological list of events, and summarizes
the results of the most recent build at the top of each column. 
Developers can periodically check this page to see how their changes
have fared. If they see red, they know that they've made a mistake and
need to fix it. If they see green, they know that they've done their
duty and don't need to worry about their change breaking anything.

     <li>If a MailNotifier status target is active, the completion of a build
will cause email to be sent to any developers whose Changes were
incorporated into this Build. The MailNotifier can be configured to
only send mail upon failing builds, or for builds which have just
transitioned from passing to failing. Other status targets can provide
similar real-time notification via different communication channels,
like IRC.

   </ul>
