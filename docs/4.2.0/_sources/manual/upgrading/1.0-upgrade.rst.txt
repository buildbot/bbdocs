.. _1.0_Upgrading:

Upgrading to Buildbot 1.0
=========================

Upgrading a Buildbot instance from 0.9.x to 1.0 does not require any changes in the master configuration.
Despite the major version bump, Buildbot 1.0 does not have major difference with the 0.9 series.
1.0.0 is rather the mark of API stability.
