<h1>Buildbot's Test Suite<a class="headerlink" href="#buildbot-s-test-suite" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Buildbot's tests are under <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">buildbot.test</span></tt> and, for the buildslave,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">buildslave.test</span></tt>.  Tests for the slave are similar to the master, although
in some cases helpful functionality on the master is not re-implemented on the
slave.</p>
<div class="section" id="suites">
<h2>Suites<a class="headerlink" href="#suites" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Tests are divided into a few suites:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Unit tests (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">buildbot.test.unit</span></tt>) - these follow unit-testing practices and
attempt to maximally isolate the system under test.  Unit tests are the main
mechanism of achieving test coverage, and all new code should be well-covered
by corresponding unit tests.</li>
<li>Interface tests (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">buildbot.test.interface</span></tt>).  In many cases, Buildbot has
multiple implementations of the same interface -- at least one &quot;real&quot;
implementation and a fake implementation used in unit testing.  The interface
tests ensure that these implementations all meet the same standards.  This
ensures consistency between implementations, and also ensures that the unit
tests are testing against realistic fakes.</li>
<li>Integration tests (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">buildbot.test.integration</span></tt>) - these test combinations
of multiple units.  Of necessity, integration tests are incomplete - they
cannot test every condition; difficult to maintain - they tend to be complex
and touch a lot of code; and slow - they usually require considerable setup
and execute a lot of code.  As such, use of integration tests is limited to a
few, broad tests to act as a failsafe for the unit and interface tests.</li>
<li>Regression tests (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">buildbot.test.regrssions</span></tt>) - these test to prevent
re-occurrence of historical bugs.  In most cases, a regression is better
tested by a test in the other suites, or unlike to recur, so this suite tends
to be small.</li>
<li>Fuzz tests (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">buildbot.test.fuzz</span></tt>) - these tests run for a long time and
apply randomization to try to reproduce rare or unusual failures.  The
Buildbot project does not currently have a framework to run fuzz tests
regularly.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="unit-tests">
<h3>Unit Tests<a class="headerlink" href="#unit-tests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Every code module should have corresponding unit tests.  This is not currently
true of Buildbot, due to a large body of legacy code, but is a goal of the
project.  All new code must meet this requirement.</p>
<p>Unit test modules are be named after the package or class they test, replacing
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.</span></tt> with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_</span></tt> and omitting the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">buildbot_</span></tt>. For example,
<tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">test_status_web_authz_Authz.py</span></tt> tests the <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Authz</span></tt> class in
<tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">buildbot/status/web/authz.py</span></tt>. Modules with only one class, or a few
trivial classes, can be tested in a single test module. For more complex
situations, prefer to use multiple test modules.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="interface-tests">
<h3>Interface Tests<a class="headerlink" href="#interface-tests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Interface tests exist to verify that multiple implementations of an interface
meet the same requirements.  Note that the name 'interface' should not be
confused with the sparse use of Zope Interfaces in the Buildbot code -- in this
context, an interface is any boundary between testable units.</p>
<p>Ideally, all interfaces, both public and private, should be tested.  Certainly,
any <em>public</em> interfaces need interface tests.</p>
<p>Interface test modules are named after the interface they are testing, e.g.,
<tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">test_mq.py</span></tt>.  They generally begin as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">buildbot.test.util</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">interfaces</span>

            <span class="k">pass</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_something</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">pass</span> <span class="c"># ...</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">RealTests</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Tests</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="c"># tests that all *real* implementations must pass</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_something_else</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">pass</span> <span class="c"># ...</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>All of the test methods are defined here, segregated into tests that all
implementations must pass, and tests that the fake implementation is not
expected to pass.  The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test_signature_someMethod</span></tt> test above illustrates the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">assertArgSpecMatches</span></tt> decorator, which can be used to compare the argument
specification of a callable with a reference implementation conveniently
written as a nested function.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the test module, a subclass is created for each
implementation, implementing the setup methods that were stubbed out in the
parent classes:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">TestFakeThing</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">unittest</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">TestCase</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Tests</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">someSetupMethod</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">pass</span> <span class="c"># ...</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">TestRealThing</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">unittest</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">TestCase</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">RealTests</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">someSetupMethod</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">pass</span> <span class="c"># ...</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>For implementations which require optional software, this is the appropriate
place to signal that tests should be skipped when their prerequisites are not
available.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="integration-tests">
<h3>Integration Tests<a class="headerlink" href="#integration-tests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Integration test modules test several units at once, including their
interactions.  In general, they serve as a catch-all for failures and bugs that
were not detected by the unit and interface tests.  As such, they should not
aim to be exhaustive, but merely representative.</p>
<p>Integration tests are very difficult to maintain if they reach into the
internals of any part of Buildbot.  Where possible, try to use the same means
as a user would to set up, run, and check the results of an integration test.
That may mean writing a <tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">master.cfg</span></tt> to be parsed, and checking the
results by examining the database (or fake DB API) afterward.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="regression-tests">
<h3>Regression Tests<a class="headerlink" href="#regression-tests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Regression tests are even more rare in Buildbot than integration tests.  In
many cases, a regression test is not necessary -- either the test is
better-suited as a unit or interface test, or the failure is so specific that a
test will never fail again.</p>
<p>Regression tests tend to be closely tied to the code in which the error
occurred.  When that code is refactored, the regression test generally becomes
obsolete, and is deleted.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fuzz-tests">
<h3>Fuzz Tests<a class="headerlink" href="#fuzz-tests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Fuzz tests generally run for a fixed amount of time, running randomized tests
against a system.  They do not run at all during normal runs of the Buildbot
tests, unless <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">BUILDBOT_FUZZ</span></tt> is defined. This is accomplished with something
like the following at the end of each test module:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">if</span> <span class="s">&#39;BUILDBOT_FUZZ&#39;</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">environ</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">del</span> <span class="n">LRUCacheFuzzer</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mixins">
<h2>Mixins<a class="headerlink" href="#mixins" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Buildbot provides a number of purpose-specific mixin classes in
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/buildbot/buildbot/blob/master/master/buildbot/util" title="master/buildbot/util"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master/buildbot/util</span></tt></a>.  These generally define a set of utility
functions as well as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">setUpXxx</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tearDownXxx</span></tt> methods.  These methods
should be called explicitly from your subclass's <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">setUp</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tearDown</span></tt>
methods.  Note that some of these methods return Deferreds, which should be
handled properly by the caller.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fakes">
<span id="id1"></span><h2>Fakes<a class="headerlink" href="#fakes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Buildbot provides a number of pre-defined fake implementations of internal
interfaces, in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/buildbot/buildbot/blob/master/master/buildbot/fake" title="master/buildbot/fake"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master/buildbot/fake</span></tt></a>.  These are designed to be used
in unit tests to limit the scope of the test.  For example, the fake DB API
eliminates the need to create a real database when testing code that uses the
DB API, and isolates bugs in the system under test from bugs in the real DB
implementation.</p>
<p>The danger of using fakes is that the fake interface and the real interface can
differ.  The interface tests exist to solve this problem.  All fakes should be
fully tested in an integration test, so that the fakes pass the same tests as
the &quot;real&quot; thing.  It is particularly important that the method signatures be
compared.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="good-tests">
<h2>Good Tests<a class="headerlink" href="#good-tests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Bad tests are worse than no tests at all, since they waste developers' time
wondering &quot;was that a spurious failure?&quot; or &quot;what the heck is this test trying
to do?&quot;  Buildbot needs good tests.  So what makes a good test?</p>
<div class="section" id="independent-of-time">
<span id="tests-independent-of-time"></span><h3>Independent of Time<a class="headerlink" href="#independent-of-time" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Tests that depend on wall time will fail. As a bonus, they run very slowly. Do
not use <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">reactor.callLater</span></tt> to wait &quot;long enough&quot; for something to happen.</p>
<p>For testing things that themselves depend on time, consider using
<tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">twisted.internet.tasks.Clock</span></tt>.  This may mean passing a clock instance to
the code under test, and propagating that instance as necessary to ensure that
all of the code using <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">callLater</span></tt> uses it.  Refactoring code for
testability is difficult, but worthwhile.</p>
<p>For testing things that do not depend on time, but for which you cannot detect
the &quot;end&quot; of an operation: add a way to detect the end of the operation!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="clean-code">
<h3>Clean Code<a class="headerlink" href="#clean-code" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Make your tests readable. This is no place to skimp on comments! Others will
attempt to learn about the expected behavior of your class by reading the
tests. As a side note, if you use a <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Deferred</span></tt> chain in your test, write
the callbacks as nested functions, rather than using methods with funny names:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">testSomething</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">d</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">doThisFirst</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">andThisNext</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">res</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">pass</span> <span class="c"># ...</span>
    <span class="n">d</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">addCallback</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">andThisNext</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">d</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This isolates the entire test into one indented block. It is OK to add methods
for common functionality, but give them real names and explain in detail what
they do.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="good-name">
<h3>Good Name<a class="headerlink" href="#good-name" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Test method names should follow the pattern <tt class="samp docutils literal"><span class="pre">test_</span><em><span class="pre">METHOD</span></em><span class="pre">_</span><em><span class="pre">CONDITION</span></em></tt>
where <em>METHOD</em> is the method being tested, and <em>CONDITION</em> is the
condition under which it's tested. Since we can't always test a single
method, this is not a hard-and-fast rule.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="assert-only-one-thing">
<h3>Assert Only One Thing<a class="headerlink" href="#assert-only-one-thing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Where practical, each test should have a single assertion. This may require a
little bit of work to get several related pieces of information into a single
Python object for comparison. The problem with multiple assertions is that, if
the first assertion fails, the remainder are not tested.  The test results then
do not tell the entire story.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="prefer-fakes-to-mocks">
<h3>Prefer Fakes to Mocks<a class="headerlink" href="#prefer-fakes-to-mocks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Mock objects are too &quot;compliant&quot;, and this often masks errors in the system
under test.  For example, a mis-spelled method name on a mock object will not
raise an exception.</p>
<p>Where possible, use one of the pre-written fake objects (see
<a class="reference internal" href="#fakes"><em>Fakes</em></a>) instead of a mock object.  Fakes
themselves should be well-tested using interface tests.</p>
<p>Where they are appropriate, Mock objects can be constructed easily using the
aptly-named <a class="reference external" href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/">mock</a> module, which is
a requirement for Buildbot's tests.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="small-tests">
<h3>Small Tests<a class="headerlink" href="#small-tests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The shorter each test is, the better. Test as little code as possible in each test.</p>
<p>It is fine, and in fact encouraged, to write the code under test in such a way
as to facilitate this. As an illustrative example, if you are testing a new
Step subclass, but your tests require instantiating a BuildMaster, you're
probably doing something wrong!</p>
<p>This also applies to test modules.  Several short, easily-digested test modules
are preferred over a 1000-line monster.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="isolation">
<h3>Isolation<a class="headerlink" href="#isolation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each test should be maximally independent of other tests. Do not leave files
laying around after your test has finished, and do not assume that some other
test has run beforehand. It's fine to use caching techniques to avoid repeated,
lengthy setup times.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="be-correct">
<h3>Be Correct<a class="headerlink" href="#be-correct" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Tests should be as robust as possible, which at a basic level means using the
available frameworks correctly. All Deferreds should have callbacks and be
chained properly. Error conditions should be checked properly. Race conditions
should not exist (see <a class="reference internal" href="#tests-independent-of-time"><em>Independent of Time</em></a>, above).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="be-helpful">
<h3>Be Helpful<a class="headerlink" href="#be-helpful" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Note that tests will pass most of the time, but the moment when they are most
useful is when they fail.</p>
<p>When the test fails, it should produce output that is helpful to the person
chasing it down. This is particularly important when the tests are run
remotely, in which case the person chasing down the bug does not have access to
the system on which the test fails. A test which fails sporadically with no
more information than &quot;AssertionFailed&quot; is a prime candidate for deletion if
the error isn't obvious. Making the error obvious also includes adding comments
describing the ways a test might fail.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="keeping-state">
<h3>Keeping State<a class="headerlink" href="#keeping-state" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Python does not allow assignment to anything but the innermost local scope or
the global scope with the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">global</span></tt> keyword.  This presents a problem when
creating nested functions:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_localVariable</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">cb_called</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">False</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">cb</span><span class="p">():</span>
        <span class="n">cb_called</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">True</span>
    <span class="n">cb</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertTrue</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">cb_called</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c"># will fail!</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cb_called</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">True</span></tt> assigns to a <em>different variable</em> than
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cb_called</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">False</span></tt>.  In production code, it's usually best to work around
such problems, but in tests this is often the clearest way to express the
behavior under test.</p>
<p>The solution is to change something in a common mutable object.  While a simple
list can serve as such a mutable object, this leads to code that is hard to
read.  Instead, use <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">State</span></tt>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">buildbot.test.state</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">State</span>
