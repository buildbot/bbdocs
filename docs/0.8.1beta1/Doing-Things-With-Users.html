<h4 class="subsection">3.6.1 Doing Things With Users</h4>

<p>Each Change has a single User who is responsible for that Change. Most
Builds have a set of Changes: the Build represents the first time these
Changes have been built and tested by the Buildbot. The build has a
&ldquo;blamelist&rdquo; that consists of a simple union of the Users responsible
for all the Build's Changes.

   <p>The Build provides (through the IBuildStatus interface) a list of Users
who are &ldquo;involved&rdquo; in the build. For now this is equal to the
blamelist, but in the future it will be expanded to include a &ldquo;build
sheriff&rdquo; (a person who is &ldquo;on duty&rdquo; at that time and responsible for
watching over all builds that occur during their shift), as well as
per-module owners who simply want to keep watch over their domain (chosen by
subdirectory or a regexp matched against the filenames pulled out of the
Changes). The Involved Users are those who probably have an interest in the
results of any given build.

   <p>In the future, Buildbot will acquire the concept of &ldquo;Problems&rdquo;,
which last longer than builds and have beginnings and ends. For example, a
test case which passed in one build and then failed in the next is a
Problem. The Problem lasts until the test case starts passing again, at
which point the Problem is said to be &ldquo;resolved&rdquo;.

   <p>If there appears to be a code change that went into the tree at the
same time as the test started failing, that Change is marked as being
resposible for the Problem, and the user who made the change is added
to the Problem's &ldquo;Guilty&rdquo; list. In addition to this user, there may
be others who share responsibility for the Problem (module owners,
sponsoring developers). In addition to the Responsible Users, there
may be a set of Interested Users, who take an interest in the fate of
the Problem.

   <p>Problems therefore have sets of Users who may want to be kept aware of
the condition of the problem as it changes over time. If configured, the
Buildbot can pester everyone on the Responsible list with increasing
harshness until the problem is resolved, with the most harshness reserved
for the Guilty parties themselves. The Interested Users may merely be told
when the problem starts and stops, as they are not actually responsible for
fixing anything.
